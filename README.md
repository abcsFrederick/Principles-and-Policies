## Principles and Policies

This repository was set up to standardize ABCS project management and
reproducible research policies across our contracts with various
government institutions. Documents are broken into two categories:

-   [Project
    Management](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/blob/main/Project-Management.md)
    and [Reproducible
    Research](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/blob/main/Reproducible-Research.md)
    documents outline overarching principles as well as specific policy
    details.
-   A directory containing
    [templates](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/tree/main/templates)
    is also included.
