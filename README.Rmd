## Principles and Policies

This repository was set up to standardize ABCS project management and reproducible research policies across our contracts with various government institutions. Documents are broken into two categories:

* [Project Management](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/blob/main/Project-Management.md) and [Reproducible Research](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/blob/main/Reproducible-Research.md) documents outline overarching principles as well as specific policy details.
* A directory containing [templates](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/Principles-and-Policies/tree/main/templates) is also included.
