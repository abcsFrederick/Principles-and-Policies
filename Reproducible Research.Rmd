This document outlines principles and policies for conducting reproducible research. We strive for excellence in our research and are working toward not only making our research reproducible, but also to increase the replicability and generalizability of our findings.

To that end we currently aim to make all of our research internally auditable. When collaborative agreements allow, we also aim to make all published research openly available and reproducible.


## 1. Auditibility

Auditable research in this context is primarily defined by internal replicability and provenance of research objects. Thus all research should have the following properties:

* All results are able to be duplicated exactly from raw data through publication within the limits of data retention.
* Documentation is included such that results duplication should be achievable by ABCS whether the original analyst is still available or not.
* Pipeline from raw data through generation of reports is fully automated, requiring no manual steps.
* Provenance of all research objects is maintained internally. That is, chronology and origin of all research objects (data, source code, figures, tables, reports, etc...) is version controlled and available for recall.


## 2. Reproducibility

Reproducibility is an extension of auditability to the research community and includes attribution. All published research should have the following properties as far as collaborative agreements allow:

* Data are openly available under creative commons licenses or deposited in appropriate repositories and referenced in publications.
* Source code is openly available under an MIT license (or similar) and citable.
* Source code provenance is auditable.
* Documentation is included such that all published results are exactly replicable, including but not limited to statistics, figures and tables.


## 3. Policies

### 3.1 Data provenance
Raw/source data from collaborators should never be edited. Any required changes should be scripted and well documented. Raw/source data should be separated from intermediate data and results (e.g. in different directories), and permissions should be modified to make the raw/source data read-only.

When a project is closed raw/source data should be archived and information for retrieval should be included in the README file of the repository. Unpublished data should be archived in HPC DME, and published data should be archived in a standard archive appropriate for the data (e.g. figshare or NCBI).

Derivative data (e.g. figures, tables, reports) not included in a manuscript or other publication and not suitable for AMP, due to the size or number of files, should be archived using the policies in this section (see comments in Sections 3.3 and 3.5). Only final results should be archived outside of AMP. Intermediate files should not be archived in HPC DME or any other archive.


### 3.2 Source code provenance
All source code will be tracked via git and follow the gitflow workflows outlined in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. Git repositories will be hosted on GitHub under the [abcsFrederick](https://github.com/abcsFrederick/) organization. The only exception to this is for projects deemed sensitive, in which case code repositories will be hosted on our internal Gitea server. Use of a git GUI such as [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is recommended.

Analysis repositories will remain private until published. The public/private status of software repositories will be determined on a case-by-case basis until the initial release, at which point they will be publicly available. GitHub tools, such as issue tracking, discussions and GitHub actions are to be used when appropriate, especially for released software repositories.

Source code repositories are to be used only for source code. A `.gitignore` file should be included in each repository to avoid pushing any data files to GitHub, including summary output like statistics, figures and tables. The only time summary output may be included is when it has been published.

Software repositories may include small data sets, or in some exceptional cases larger data sets. Git LFS should be used in these cases. Whenever possible, larger data sets should be archived in a data repository such as [figshare](https://figshare.com/) or an [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) repository, and instructions and helper tools should be included in the software package to import directly from these repositories.

All projects in AMP should link to their respective GitHub repositories in the project metadata.

#### 3.2.1 Automation
All commits on the main branch of analysis repositories should contain a single master script that will run the entire analysis from raw data input through generation of reports. This should require no manual steps (e.g. no copy/paste, no hand editing of figures, no formatting of tables in excel), and all outputs should be identical to those published or shared with collaborators.

GitHub actions for code building and testing automation should be utilized for all public software repositories.

#### 3.2.2 Analysis Workflow
Repositories for analysis projects may utilize a single branch, but multiple branches may also be used for more complex projects. Analysis project code should be documented and committed following the principles outlined in Section 3.2.4. When research objects are shared with collaborators, the associated commit should be tagged with the following information:

* Tag version: Date that results were shared with collaborators or date of project close, formatted `%Y-%m-%d` (e.g. "2021-03-08")
* Title: A short description of what was published or shared with collaborators
* Description (optional): Any additional relevant information. For example, this could be a short summary of feedback from collaborators regarding the results.

#### 3.2.3 Software Workflow
A simplified version of gitflow should be used for source code associated with software projects. All commits on the main branch should be considered deployable and should not contain partially finished code. Use of pull requests and code review is encouraged when merging with the main branch. Branches should be utilized as follows (see branch diagram below):

* main: The main branch is reserved for released versions of the software. Nothing should be directly committed to this branch. Releases should be merged into main using a pull request from either the dev branch, when a new version is ready for release, or from a hotfix branch for bug updates that can't wait for the next release.
* dev: The dev branch is where development occurs. Major features may be broken out and worked on in individual feature branches for more complicated software packages. When a feature is complete, it is merged into the dev branch.
* feature (optional): A feature branch is created for each new feature, and work proceeds until it is complete and ready to merge into the dev branch. Depending on the complexity of the software package, feature branches may not be necessary. Each feature branch should be given a human-readable name.
* hotfix (optional): A hotfix branch is created for each bug fix that needs to be addressed before the next release and should be associated with an issue in the issue tracker. The naming convention is the issue number and a human readable label. For example: "23-VCF-output-format".

#### 3.2.4 Documentation
Documentation styles may vary from person to person, but should minimally include the following:

* Source code is written with readability in mind, including ample white space and comments.
* README files in the root directory of each repository clearly outline the purpose of the repository, give a brief overview of the source code and explain where to obtain raw data.
* Human-readable branch names are used according to the conventions outlined above.
* Commits should be frequent enough to contain discrete changes to code, and they should also contain complete updates. For example: data wrangling, model exploration and figures should not be included in one giant commit, and neither should a block of code that generates a single table be spread over multiple little commits.
* Commit messages contain a short, descriptive header. Any additional details are shared on subsequent lines. For example:
```
Correlation figure shared on 2/25/21
Changes to the correlation figure:
* now uses a colorblind-friendly pallete
* font size increase on axes
* changed dimensions
```

### 3.3 Provenance of other research objects
Email communications with collaborators should be logged in an external thread within [AMP](https://abcs-amp.cancer.gov/). This is mostly easily accomplished in the communications tab of a project in AMP. By extension, all figures, tables and reports shared with collaborators via email should also be stored in AMP. Large files that can not be emailed should be archived and shared following the policies in Section 3.1, and a link to the data should be noted in AMP.

### 3.4 Reproducibility
As discussed in Section 3.2.1, commits on the main branch should be automated. To aid with reproducibility, all relevant system information should also be given, including but not limited to operating system details and software packages and versions. The use of the [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, [Conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html), or other environments can be helpful. At a minimum, this information should be located near the top of the master script for the project or in the README for the repository.

### 3.5 AMP
The [Analysis Management Portal (AMP)](https://abcs-amp.cancer.gov/) is the primary source for all information regarding projects. Information stored in AMP is not only used for the purposes of Auditability discussed in Section 1, but also for monthly reporting. The following information and research objects should be stored in AMP:

* Link to GitHub repository - this belongs in the project metadata under GitHub. See the Project Details, and use the edit link to add/edit this information.
* Internal discussion - Internal email discussions between analysts should be logged in an internal thread. This is most easily accomplished under the Internal tab for each project. Replies to an existing email thread will also be captured.
* Collaborator communications - Email correspondence with external collaborators should be logged in an external thread. This is most easily accomplished under the Communications tab for each project. Replies to an existing email thread will also be captured.
* Document storage - Figures, tables and reports that are small enough to email should be included when shared with collaborators or when relevant to internal discussions.
